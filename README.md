Tetris Game in python using OOP

This is a simple Tetris game written in C++ using object-oriented programming (OOP). The game is implemented using the following classes:

TetrisGame: This class represents the overall game state and controls the game loop.
Tetromino: This class represents a single Tetris piece.
Board: This class represents the Tetris board.
To play the game, simply run the main.cpp file. The game will start with a new Tetris piece falling from the top of the board. Use the arrow keys to move the piece left, right, and down. You can also rotate the piece using the space bar.

If the piece reaches the bottom of the board without any empty spaces below it, the game is over. Otherwise, the piece will lock into place and any complete lines will be cleared.

The game ends when the board is full of Tetris pieces.

How to build and run the game

To build and run the game, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed. Once you have a compiler installed, you can build the game by running the following command:


./tetris
Tips for playing the game

Here are a few tips for playing the game:

Try to keep the board as empty as possible. This will give you more room to maneuver new Tetris pieces.
If you see a complete line, try to clear it as soon as possible. This will give you more points and make it easier to keep the board empty.
Don't panic if the board starts to fill up. You can always try to rotate or move the current Tetris piece to a different location.
Have fun!
